# Helpful Source Codes Repository

First of all: **Feel free to help us!**

Second (Ok, now!): **Feel free to sugest anything!**

## Description

Here, we create this simple repository to provide some codes in Fortran/Python that can be useful for analysis, conversion and data processing. We also intend to make available some free codes in Python. This repository will allow all users to have a basic knowledge about the Python language, such as: 

Some available codes for instance are:

* Folders:
  * Crustal modeling by using rectangular prism
  * Upward continuation for gravity and magnetic data
  * Normal gravity calculation (1980 formula)
  * Step by step for gravity corrections
* Source-codes and notebooks:
  * Discrete Fourier transform 
  * Matrix to XYZ data-conversion
  * XYZ to Matrix data-conversion
  * Simple log profile and clay values calculation
  * Simple example for PI calculation

Those XYZ_Matrix codes are not available in Python source yet.

**Moving on!**

As a Mathematician and Geophysicist as well, I will also provide some functions and notebooks created to compute and create datasets related to those mentioned areas. All examples will be placed on directories.

All your questions can be directed to **nelsondelimar@gmail.com**.
